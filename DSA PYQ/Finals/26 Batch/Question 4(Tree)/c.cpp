// Advantages of Binary Search Tree (BST) over Linked List and Array

// BST provides faster search (O(log n)) and efficient insertions/deletions (O(log n)) in balanced trees,
//  while Linked Lists and Arrays are slower (O(n)) for search and insertion/deletion.
// BST keeps data sorted, supporting efficient range queries (O(log n + k)), while Linked Lists and Arrays don't guarantee sorted data.
// BST allows ordered data access and dynamic resizing, unlike Arrays (fixed size) and Linked Lists (slow search).

// Disadvantages of Binary Search Tree (BST) over Linked List and Array

// BST can become unbalanced (O(n) operations), while Linked Lists and Arrays are not affected by balance.
// BST has higher memory overhead due to pointers and is harder to implement than Linked Lists and Arrays.
// BST does not support random access (O(log n) search vs. O(1) in Arrays).
