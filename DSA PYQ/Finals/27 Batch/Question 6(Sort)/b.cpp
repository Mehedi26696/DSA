// b) Merge sort is a sorting algorithm involving divide, conquer, and combine operations.

// 1.Which of these mentioned steps is associated with its base case swapping? 
// 2.In which case, based on the size of the input data, may merge sort not be as efficient or suitable as compared to sorting algorithm having quadratic complexity algorithms? And why? 
// Mention names of two such algorithms.

// 3.Under what circumstance(s) is the counting sort algorithm inappropriate?



// Answer:
// 1. Combine operation is associated with its base case swapping.Because in merge sort, the base case is when the size of the input data is 1.
// In this case, the input data is already sorted. So, the combine operation is used to merge the sorted data.

// 2. Merge sort may not be as efficient or suitable as compared to sorting algorithms having quadratic complexity algorithms when the size of the input data is small.
// This is because the overhead of the divide and merge operations in merge sort is higher than the overhead of the comparison-based sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort.
// Two such algorithms are:
// a. Bubble sort
// b. Insertion sort

// 3. Counting sort algorithm is inappropriate under the following circumstances:
// a. When the range of input data is very large.
// b. When the input data is not integers or when the input data is not discrete.
// c. When the input data is not uniformly distributed.
// d. When the input data is negative.
// e. When the input data is floating-point numbers.
// f. When the input data is strings or other non-numeric data types.
// g. When the input data is too sparse or too dense.
// h. When the input data is not known in advance.
// i. When the input data is not uniformly distributed.
