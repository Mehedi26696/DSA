//  a) Explain the definition of Big O complexity in understanding a code's performance.

// Answer: Big O complexity is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's 
// time complexity in terms of the input size. It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales as the input size increases.
