// c) You are given a function, f(n) = 7n3 + 9n+ 5, representing a code fragment's actual runtime complexity. 
// "The big theta (0) complexity of the function is n2." Justify the argument using your own words.

// Answer: The big theta (Θ) complexity of a function represents the tight bound on the growth rate of the function's time complexity.
// In this case, the function f(n) = 7n^3 + 9n + 5 has a big theta (Θ) complexity of n^2. This means that the function's time complexity grows at a rate
// that is bounded above and below by n^2. In other words, the function's performance is directly proportional to n^2, and it is not significantly
// affected by the other terms in the function (7n^3 and 9n). This indicates that the dominant factor in determining the function's performance is the n^2 term,
// and the function's growth rate is tightly bounded by n^2. Therefore, the big theta (Θ) complexity of the function is n^2.
