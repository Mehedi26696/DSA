 
// Question

// We know that a queue can be implemented using various data structures, including arrays and linked
// lists. Is there any relationship between the above statement and the nature of queues being an
// Abstract Data Type (ADT)?
// Now, with a suitable example, discuss how the implementation choice of an ADT can impact the
// benefits of a circular queue.

// Answer

// Yes, there is a relationship between the statement and the nature of queues being an Abstract Data
// Type (ADT). An ADT is a type of data structure that is defined by its operations, not by its
// implementation. This means that the operations of the data structure are well-defined, but the
// implementation details can vary. For example, a queue is defined by its operations, such as enqueue
// (add an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (remove an element from the front of the
// queue), but the implementation details of how these operations are carried out can vary. A queue can
// be implemented using an array, a linked list, or other data structures, but as long as the
// operations are well-defined, it is still a queue.

// The implementation choice of an ADT can impact the benefits of a circular queue. A circular queue is a
// type of queue in which the front and back of the queue are connected, forming a circle. This allows
// elements to be added and removed from the queue in a circular manner, which can be more efficient
// than a regular queue in some cases. For example, if the front of the queue is at the end of the
// array, elements can be added to the front of the queue by wrapping around to the beginning of the
// array, which can be more efficient than shifting all the elements in the array to make room for the
// new element.
